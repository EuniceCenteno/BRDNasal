Centeno-Martinez, R.E., Glidden, N., Mohan, S. et al. Identification of bovine respiratory disease through the nasal microbiome. anim microbiome 4, 15 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1186/s42523-022-00167-y

This study focused on characterizing the nasal microbiome community of animals with visual Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) clinical signs vs apparently healthy pen-mates Holstein. The study was performed at Indiana, USA.

The nasal microbiome was analized using 16S rRNA sequencing. The bacterial sequences were deoposited in the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) database under Bioproject PRJNA746809, BioSamples SAMN20244099â€“SAMN20244251 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA746809
